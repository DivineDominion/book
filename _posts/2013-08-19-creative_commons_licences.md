Licences are a topic many researchers shy away from. And it is common
behavior that property rights are unknowingly signed away. In this
little section we would like to present the different creative commons
licences one is oftentimes confronted with. This book for instance is
published under a creative commons license. They are widely used and
especially popular online and it is helpful to any researcher to
understand what they mean.

  This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.                                                                                              This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and it is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.
