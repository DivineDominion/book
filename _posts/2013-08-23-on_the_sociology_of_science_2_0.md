While the previous chapters of this book reveal some technical
principles of Science 2.0, here we look at the psychological and
sociological motives of researchers using these novel tools. In this
chapter we will see how and why the main drivers of scientists in the
internet are different from usual “offline” scientists. We consider here
an internet-geek (driven by the psychological principles described
below), assuming that he/she is also a scientist (the potential audience
of Science 2.0). So how would such a person behave?

Let us first outline the classical understanding of the usual "offline"
scientist. About 70 years ago Robert Merton (1942) summarized some of
the basic sociological principles that drive scientists, the Mertonian
norms of science, often referred to by the acronym “CUDOS”. These
include *communalism* – the common ownership of scientific discoveries,
according to which scientists give up intellectual property in exchange
for recognition and esteem; *universalism* – according to which claims
to truth are evaluated in terms of universal or impersonal criteria, and
not on the basis of race, class, gender, religion, or nationality;
*disinterestedness* – according to which scientists are rewarded for
acting in ways that outwardly appear to be selfless; *organized
skepticism* – all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous,
structured community scrutiny.

In addition to the Mertonian principles, western scientists are also
governed by the economic principles outlined in the “Republic of
Science" by Michael Polanyi (1962) about half a century ago. These
economic principles have become extremely important now, when the era of
"scientific Eldorado" has finished and scientists have to make efforts
just to remain in science. Economic pressure dictates that scientists
are rewarded for being productive, competitive, and successful.
Scientists need to publish as much as possible, as often as possible,
and do their best to advertise their work through all types of media so
as to attract citations, funding, and recognition. Sociologically, all
of the forces mentioned above, whether they are egoistic or altruistic,
are job-centric. This is true for conventional "offline" scientists. Is
it still true for Science 2.0?

To address this question, the author has conducted a survey online. 50
most active users of one of the leading scientific online communities,
professional life scientists with Ph.D. degree, were asked the following
question: “What are you doing here?”. The respondents were given several
choices and were asked to choose *only one* answer, most closely
resembling their feelings. Below is a summary of received answers:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------
I am having here a nice time **and** it is useful for my work (\~50/50)      40 %
I am having here a nice time, relaxing after work                            19 %
I am polishing my scientific arguments in online discussions                 12 %
I am addicted to Internet. I would like to leave this resource but can not   10 %
I am getting here some useful information for my work                        5 %
I am popularizing my scientific ideas/publications                           5 %
I am advertising my products/services                                        5 %
I am helping other members, and I like it                                    2 %
I am maintaining contacts with my colleagues here                            2 %
I am here mainly to exchange PDF articles free of charge                     0 %
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------

This survey presents quite surprising results for the advocates of
Science 2.0. Firstly, we see that the overstated need for free access to
scientific publications is not the driving force at all (none of the 50
respondents was using social tools to exchange PDFs of articles behind
subscriptions). Secondly, the "facebook-type" activity of maintaining
contacts with "friends" is negligible (just 2% of respondents use
Science 2.0 tools to maintain contacts with colleagues). As expected,
few people use social media to sell/buy/advertise something scientific
(5% for each of these categories). Now we come to the largest shares.
10% of scientists openly say in this anonymous survey that they are
simply addicted to the Internet (in the negative sense). 12% use
scientific tools online to polish their arguments (probably before
publication). 19% enjoy Science 2.0 tools just for fun. Finally, 40% of
scientists combine fun and usefulness for work. (Compare with just 5% of
scientists who answered that they are using Science 2.0 tools primarily
to get something useful to work). Taken together, these data explain why
scientific social media has failed to attract the majority of usual
“offline” scientists. Just the basic motivation behind most Science 2.0
systems offering services other than the top three lines of this survey
is wrong. Nothing is wrong with scientists. Something is wrong with
Science 2.0, which needs to be more flexible. Acknowledging the huge
progress reached by Science 2.0, we have to admit that it still requires
large changes, and the next wave of science, Science 3.0, is yet to come
(Teif 2013, 2009).
