Scientific publications - ranging from full papers, abstracts, and
presentations to posters, including grant applications and blog posts -
are usually written by one or a few authors and then corrected and
reviewed by many authors. Collaboration on scientific publications is a
cornerstone of science. Many novel tools exist that can be integrated
and facilitate this process. However, novel disadvantages come with the
changes of the workflow - the future will tell as to which way to work
on documents will be the most efficient one.

Here we will discuss several ways of organizing collaboration and
discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

The **1.0 way** of organizing collaboration:

-   Sending out emails with texts, presentations and manual tracking of
    the version number
-   Using the track change or compare documents functionality of word
    processing tools
-   Using data transfer protocols, such as shared local networks or FTP
    to transfer larger files
-   Manual tracking of versions, backups, etc.

Advantage:

-   Current state of the art
-   Full data control - the process can be organized, so that only known
    and trusted parties gain access to the content
-   Politics - authors and co-authors can decide who sees which version
    and when
-   Free and open source solutions available

Disadvantage:

-   Can be hard to keep track of edits and to integrate changes into a
    summarized version
-   Many “local cultures of keeping track of versions”
-   Simultaneous work needs central organization (leading author?) and
    might create high workload to keep versions in sync

Solutions:

-   Standard Email and document processor software packages, FTP,
    network file systems
-   MS Office solutions
-   Open Office
-   Text editors, LaTex

The **cloud way** of organizing collaboration:

-   Using cloud tools that synchronize folders within the work group and
    create a version history / backup of old files
-   Using collaborative authoring tools to work simultaneously on
    documents

Advantage:

-   Simultaneous work
-   No out-of-sync version of documents
-   Complete history
-   No work load overhead for version synchronization and file transfer
    management

Disadvantages:

-   Only 97% compatibility with current standard word or presentation
    software solutions
-   Third party companies gain access to data and texts, therefore have
    to be trusted
-   Most free solutions are high-maintenance and need high amount of
    training, local cloud solutions may lack features
-   Scepticism regarding novel concepts with both good and bad arguments
    (the old fashioned way is usually perceived as secure and well
    established, while disadvantages of novel concepts are
    over-perceived)
-   Collaborative authoring tools do not relieve authors from
    recursively checking the internal integrity of the documents - low
    threshold to submit changes may decrease the diligence of
    contributors

Solutions (examples):

-   Dropbox
-   Google documents/drive
-   ResearchGate
-   Zotero
-   other Concurrent version systems (social coding!) with front ends to
    focus on collaborative text editing
